## About Me

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Atmospheric Environmental Science at **Hong Kong University of Science and Technology** under supervision of [Prof Xiaoming Shi](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=xiaoming-shi-shixm). My research involves numerical weather forecasting, turbulence parameterization and extreme orographic precipitation under global warming. Prior to joining the PhD programe, I obtained my bachelor degrees from the University of Manchester and Nanjing University of Information, Science and Technology. 

I spend my lesisure time in playing badminton and body buiding. After moving to Hong Kong, I also developed a new hobby- hiking. At most weekends, I visit various hiking trails with my friends. 


## Research Interests

- **Extreme preciptation:** Tropical cyclone, orographic precipitation, gloabl warming
- **Numerical weather forecasting:** Numerical advection scheme, turbulence parameterization, turbulence gray zone 


## News

- **[July. 2023]** Our paper about extreme orographic precipitation is accepted to **Journal of Climate**.
