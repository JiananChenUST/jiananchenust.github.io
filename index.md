## About Me

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Atmospheric Environmental Science at **Hong Kong University of Science and Technology** under supervision of [Prof Xiaoming Shi](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=xiaoming-shi-shixm). My research involves numerical weather forecasting, turbulence parameterization and extreme orographic precipitation under global warming. Prior to joining the PhD programe, I obtained my bachelor degrees from the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) and [Nanjing University of Information, Science and Technology](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%8D%97%E4%BA%AC%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6/382077). 

I spend my lesisure time in playing badminton and body buiding. After moving to Hong Kong, I also developed a new hobby- hiking. At most weekends, I visit various hiking trails with my friends. 


## Research Interests
